and also make the realistic seats booking seats layout.

EX flight number=AA12AA class=First Class jd=15/Sep/2024 then seat = 1A

flight number=AA12AA class=First Class jd=16/Sep/2024 then seat = 1A

now flight number=AA12AA class=First Class jd=15/Sep/2024 then seat = 1B

the seat allocation automatically based on the flight number flight class and jd(journey date)


If any issues with Current Version occurs then need to be a Feature Look......

Like Adding new Airports with The Fares Between the Airports

and try to link SKA-airline to ska bank at for admin side ticket booking time only already user side both ticket booking and cancellation done and at admin side also ticket cancellation done but at time of ticket booking it not mandatory but easy to calculate or audits 

ie when admin ticket book then fund need to increase to the bank ac of ska airlines account 106 or its not mandatory because we already fetched the total available funds in airline reservation

THE_END..........
